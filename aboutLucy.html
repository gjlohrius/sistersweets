        <p class="lucyPa">"I started baking with my grandmother teaching me. 
          She had a lot of old recipes that were written down; some that she 
          made and some that were passed down in her family. I really loved how
          much we got to spend time together when baking so I always wanted to 
          bake with her. Eventually, I got old enough and wanted to try it more
          myself, and I don't get to bake as much with my grandmother anymore. 
          But I have grown to love baking on my own because I get to make all 
          the decisions and I have learned to do some recipes from the heart and 
          not measure anything out. 
        <br><br>
          I also grew to love baking so much because
          of my brother who loves my desserts and because they are so delicious 
          so anyone can enjoy them. I also bake to take a little break and just 
          focus on making something and not like school or anything else. 
        <br><br>
          I eventually worked towards decorating what I baked, like cupcakes and sugar cookies, 
          and kept getting better at it with practice. I then started the business for friends and
          families to bake whatever they wanted with full customization. I love doing this
          because I get to be very creative and feel proud of my creations."
